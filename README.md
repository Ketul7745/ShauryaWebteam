Hi Shaurya Web team, this is Ketul Sagar. I'll describe what I've done in breif
I've created a very basic registration form with all the necessary logic required and I think that atleast in logic department I tried my best and also have done the bonus task. The only thing lacking is the design, as of submitting the design is little to none. The main reason for it is that I could not implement it in just 3-4 days and I also have to attend a family function on the day of submission. Hope you guys like it.
